<p>This tool makes it easy to reuse images from Wikipedia and the free media archive Wikimedia Commons.</p>
<p>Please note: The current English version of the Attribution Generator is based on a near-verbatim translation of the initial German text snippets, which were drafted with the copyright law of Germany in mind. Especially the parts explaining legal concepts might thus differ from the copyright law situation of other countries.</p>
<p>In many cases images on Wikipedia and the free media archive Wikimedia Commons are protected by copyright. However most of them have been released under free licenses by their rights holders, especially under Creative Commons licenses. Some are even free of any rights, in the public domain. Free licenses facilitate an easy re-use as long as the respective license requirements are honoured. An additional permission from rights holders is then not necessary. This tool is designed to help comply with the license conditions and simplify the use of freely licensed content. Thus, the tool automatically compiles all relevant license information in to a so-called license notice that has to be published or displayed as closely to the image as reasonably possible (depending on the publication type the license notice can also be placed at another common position e.g. within picture credits in a book or opening or final credits of a video).  The tool leads you through a short dialogue and compiles all the information that is relevant for generating a correct license notice for your individual use case. After having answered these few questions you can quickly and easily copy the license notice in various formats and paste it into your publication. Currently, the tool covers the re-use in digital and printed works, being the most frequent forms of use. Other uses (e.g. exhibitions, broadcasts, live performances) remain unconsidered for the time being.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Dr. Till Jaeger, specialist lawyer for copyright and media law (JBB Rechtsanwälte in Berlin) for his generous support.</p>

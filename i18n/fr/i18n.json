It is, furthermore, recommendable to inform other users about the public domain status of this image.</p><p>In some countries (including Germany) there are regularly claims for the protection of photographic reproductions of works in the public domain. This applies both to pictures of sculptures and other three-dimensional works as well as photos of paintings.

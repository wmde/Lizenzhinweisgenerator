<p>This tool helps you to generate a correct license notice for freely licensed images. Such a
    license notice is needed in case you want to republish or reuse a freely licensed image in a way
    that requires, under copyright law, permission from the copyright holder. A publication in the
    legal sense happens e. g. when posting images on your blog or in social networks as well as
    using images in a printed work intended for public dissemination. If you intend to use the image
    in a purely private context amongst your family and friends you are not bound by any conditions
    imposed by license requirements. Thus, a license notice is not required. However, we would
    suggest to provide a license notice anyways as it can be very hard for non-lawyers to assess the
    boundaries of purely private use. Private use, in its common meaning, is for instance sending an
    image via email to your friends or using a printed image for decorational purposes in your own
    home.</p>

              target="_blank">legal exceptions</a> to the strict requirement of obtaining permission
    from the copyright holder apply for the reuse within the scope of.scientific publications or as
    quotes. In such cases you are free to choose whether you want to comply only with the statutory
    requirements (e.g. standard requirement to name the source of a quote) or with the Creative
    Commons license conditions.</p>
